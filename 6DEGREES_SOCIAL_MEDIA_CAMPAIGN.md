• Elegant serif for brand statements
• Clean sans-serif for readability  
• Professional Arabic typography
• Perfect hierarchy across both languages

OUR SOLUTION:
🔤 Houstiq (Serif) - Headlines, elegant moments
🔤 Inter (Sans-serif) - Body text, navigation
🔤 Cairo - Arabic content, cultural authenticity

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
• Custom @font-face loading for performance
• Responsive sizing (16px minimum for readability)
• Optimized line-heights (1.5-1.6 for body)
• Language-specific font stacks
• Fallback fonts for loading states

Both languages feel native, not forced.
Both audiences feel respected, not secondary.

**Format**: Text-focused with supporting graphic  
**Visual**: Key insights graphic

**Caption**:
```
LESSONS FROM THE FIELD: Building Bilingual Brand Websites 📚

What we learned building Tiara Beauty's website:

1️⃣ RTL ISN'T JUST FLIPPED TEXT
   True RTL support requires rethinking layouts, not just text direction.
   Headers, menus, and navigation all need special consideration.

2️⃣ PERFORMANCE MATTERS MORE FOR MOBILE
   With mobile-dominant traffic in Saudi Arabia, optimization isn't optional.
   Every KB and every second counts.

3️⃣ BRAND CONSISTENCY NEEDS SYSTEMS
   CSS variables and design systems ensure brand colors and styles 
   stay consistent across all pages without manual checking.

4️⃣ TYPOGRAPHY MAKES THE BRAND
   Choosing the right fonts for both languages creates cohesion.
   Cairo for Arabic was crucial for professional, culturally-appropriate text.

5️⃣ STATIC SITES CAN BE SOPHISTICATED
   Not every project needs a complex CMS or framework.
   Sometimes, elegant simplicity is the right choice.

6️⃣ CLIENT COLLABORATION IS KEY
   Understanding brand philosophy deeply leads to better design decisions.
   Regular communication prevents surprises.

These insights now inform every project we take on.
