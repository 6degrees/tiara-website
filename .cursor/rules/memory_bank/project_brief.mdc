# Project Brief: Tiara Beauty Website

## Project Overview

The Tiara Beauty Website is a static website built from a Webflow export that serves as the digital presence for Tiara Beauty, a Saudi-born beauty brand. The website showcases the brand's philosophy, services, products, and team while maintaining an elegant, refined aesthetic that reflects the brand's commitment to ritual and intentional care.

## Primary Objectives

3. **Product Display**: Showcase Tiara's beauty products (lashes, glue, glue remover, lash shampoo) in an appealing gallery format
4. **Brand Storytelling**: Communicate Tiara's philosophy and values through carefully crafted content and visual design
5. **Team Introduction**: Present the Tiara Artisans team in an elegant, professional manner
