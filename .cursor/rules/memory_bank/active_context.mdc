## Current Focus

**Active Work**: None currently—website is in stable state

**Next Steps**: Awaiting user direction for any new features, updates, or refinements

## Pending Questions

None at this time.

## Active Decisions

1. **Team Images**: Displayed in black and white via CSS filter (not converted files) for flexibility
2. **Color System**: Using CSS variables for all brand colors to ensure consistency
3. **Image Organization**: Products, services, and team images organized in dedicated subdirectories
4. **Development Server**: Using http-server on port 3004 for local development

## Critical Considerations

- **Image Optimization**: Some team images (JPG) are large (2-6MB) and could benefit from optimization for production
- **Browser Cache**: Users may need to hard refresh to see updated images and styles
- **Responsive Images**: Responsive image sets are implemented but could be expanded for better performance
- **Brand Consistency**: All new content should align with brand colors and typography defined in CSS variables

## Known Issues

None currently identified.

## Temporary State

No temporary workarounds or experimental features in place.

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Monitor for any user requests for updates or new features
2. Consider image optimization if performance becomes a concern
3. Maintain brand consistency in any future updates
